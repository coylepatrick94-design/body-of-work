## ✍️ Why Cursor?

## 💡 What I’d Build  
If I join Cursor, here are a couple ideas I’m excited about:  
1. **Timeline Mode:** A feature to rewind and replay your coding session with AI commentary.  
2. **In-Editor PR Summaries:** Auto-generated, AI-powered pull request summaries to speed up reviews.
